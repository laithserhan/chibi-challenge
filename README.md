Chibi Challenge
===============

Remove all 28 squares from the board in a neverending series of calm, randomized puzzles in a pixelated, hard-to-see resolution.

Chibi Challenge is fun for all ages. Are you ready for the challenge?

A tiny, 64x64 demake of my game [Patrick's Cyberpunk Challenge](https://github.com/tobiasvl/patrick) for the [LOWREZJAM](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2018). For the full experience, including a riveting plot in a harsh, dystopian world, please play that game.

## Instructions

The object of the game is to move Patrick around the game board and remove all 28 squares. Squares with coloured balls will remove extra squares and can make the game trickier.

The games are randomly generated, but you can also create your own games or input game codes made by others.

### Controls

* **Arrow keys / mouse**: Select square
* **Z / mouse click**: Move

### Puzzle codes

Puzzles are represented by the seven numbers in the top left corner. You can write down codes from interesting random puzzles you encounter, or make your own puzzles in the "Custom" mode and share the codes with your friends.

The codes are compatible with _Patrick's Challenge II_. You can also go to Reldni's website to [find more codes](http://web.archive.org/web/20020127141411fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/archive/patrick2.html#CODES) and play hand-crafted Reldni puzzles.

You currently have to use the mouse to place the objects in the correct squares manually, but I hope to have keyboard support soon so you can type in the codes. I also plan to add support for saving puzzles, so you can make your own (limited) run of puzzles to get a high score in.
